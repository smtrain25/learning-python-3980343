# the len() function calculates the length of a sequence
print(len(mystring))
print(len(mynumbers))


# the max() and min() functions will find the largest and smallest value in a sequence
print(max(mynumbers))
print(max(mystring))
print(min(mynumbers))
print(min(mystring))

# the str() function will return a string version of an object
prefix = "result: "
result = 5
print(prefix + str(result))

# range(start, stop, step) will create a range of numbers 
# You can use ranges along with loops 
for i in range(5,15):
  print(i)

for i in range(5,len(mystring), 2):
  print(mystring[i])

# the print function itself is pretty flexible - you can embed variables directly in it
greeting = "Hello!"
count = 10
print(f"{greeting} You are visitor number {count}.")
